# myCodingBat project

I try proceed all exercise on the http://codingbat.com/ 
I use Linux CentOs 7 with virtualenv for more than 2 versions of python (2.7.9 & 3.6.0). Sometime i switch to my notebook with installed linux Mint 18. 

NB Iâ€™m doing this in my spare time

I selected Python section at first. After i complete all Python section, i make decision - starting or not Java section, because i have not enough skill in Java in this time.
